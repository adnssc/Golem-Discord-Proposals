This is the template to be used for new GDP submissions. Note this has been heavily inspired by Ethereum [EIP template](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/eip-template.md).

The GDP number will be assigned by an editor. A GAP summary document shall be submitted by opening a pull request with GDP-related files placed in `./gdps/gap-draft_title/` directory. To submit your GDP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `gdp-draft_title.md`.

## Abstract

Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.

## Motivation

The motivation section should describe the "why" of this GDP. What problem does it solve? What benefit does it provide to the Golem Discord?
