# Golem-Discord-Proposals

Welcome to the official repository for the Golem Discord Proposals.
The purpose of this repository is to have a mostly community governed Discord to encourage openness and democratized decisions around bots.

Please note that the final descision is always to be made by the Golem Factory, but we strive not to intervene as much as possible.

## How to start a proposal

Please submit a PR to the proposals directory with your proposal to get started.

### What happens after a proposal has been approved?

Golem Factory will create a repository for the bot and the work can start.
