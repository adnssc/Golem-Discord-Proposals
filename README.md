# Golem-Discord-Proposals

Welcome to the official repository for the Golem Discord Proposals.
The purpose of this repository is to have a mostly community governed Discord to encourage openness and democratized decisions around bots.

Please note that the final descision is always to be made by the Golem Factory, but we strive not to intervene as much as possible.

## How to start a proposal

Fork the repository and use the template as a base for your proposal. When done submit a PR to the repository with the proposal placed inside the proposals directory. Now discussion can start taking place.

### What happens after a proposal has been approved?

Golem Factory will create a repository for the bot and the work can start.
