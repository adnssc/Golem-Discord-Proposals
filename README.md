# Golem-Discord-Proposals

Welcome to the official repository for the Golem Discord Proposals.
The purpose of this repository is to have a mostly community governed Discord to encourage openness and democratized decisions around bots.

Please note that the final descision is always to be made by the Golem Factory, but we strive not to intervene as much as possible.

## How to start a proposal

Please submit a PR to this repository with the gdp-template filled out and place it inside the gpds directory, so the looks like the following scheme: `./gdps/gdp-draft_title/gdp-title.md`

### What happens after a PR is made?

New PR's will be moved into the Draft project kaban until the template is valid.
Once the template is filled out correctly, then the submission will move into a valid state, and from there discussion should take place.
This discussion should be about if this submission is relevant and brings any value to the Discord.

### Approvals / Rejections

When a submission enters a valid state, it is sent to the #GDP-votes channel over on the Discord. Only Discord members with the role Community Warriors are able to vote on the submission, and the vote will run for 7 days.
When a submission is a approved, the Golem team will create a repository for the submission and development can be started.
If a submission is rejected, then nothing happens.
