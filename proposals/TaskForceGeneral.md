title: Task Force General
description: Purpose of this bot is to act like a google search engine but only answering golem related questions (or you can call it FAQ bot), 
             use case would be a new member having issues with setting up a node, or running something on golem, where community warriors or any other members would run 
             the command "!answer [question]", where the bot will using some keyword logic find a answer to the question proposed, and display it with a nicely formated embed.
             Databsae where bot will pull questions/answers would be filled over time, whenever a question with no answers occurres. (from start there will be 50/100 questions)
